Chapter Leader

I would first like you to read and complete the [Leader acknowledgment form.](https://owasp.wufoo.com/forms/z195uc930thgqcj/)

**OWASP Chapter Governance** 
While local chapters operate, for the most part, independently from the OWASP Foundation, they are not stand-alone legal entities. Local OWASP Chapters are essentially small local “arms” or “branches” of the OWASP Foundation and must abide by any legal and financial duties or responsibilities imposed on the OWASP Foundation. Furthermore, local chapters and chapter leaders are governed by the OWASP Foundation through the Executive Director and the Global OWASP Board. 

* Must have a minimum of two and maximum of five volunteers to start a new or reactivate an OWASP chapter with a maximim of five volunteers to leader the chapter.
* A chapter is to hold three meeting activities that are free and open for anyone to attend every year(12 months). 
* The meetings are to be discoverable on the OWASP chapter page on owasp.org. Discoverable for the registration or RSVP that has the date, time, and physical or virtual location to attend.
* Logo for chapter aligns with [Branding](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/branding) and [Word mark usage guidlines](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/mark-usage-guidelines) 
    * Customization of OWASP identity graphics is a way to reflect the individual characteristics of conferences, events, chapters, and projects. The branding guidelines allow for minimal customization of identity graphics. Background images, such as a country flag to identify a local chapter, may be acceptable as long as it does not obscure the branded identity. All customized identity graphics, including logos, banners, avatars, cover photos, presentation templates, etc., must follow these guidelines. Questionable practices include changing the circle to a square, altering the angle of the wasp feature, using non-branded wasp images, copyrighted images, and any other treatment that alters or obscures the OWASP brand. The OWASP Foundation reserves the right to request changes to any graphic that does not comply with these rules.
* Shared Services the Foundation offers and will provide to a chapter. To obtain submit a [contact us ticket](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/user/login?destination=portals) for each.** 
    * OWASP.org account
    * Chapter page repository that is accessed via GitHub user ID.
    * Meetup.com Chapter group
    * Shared Zoom account  
    * Chapter-Leader Google Group

* To be an active leader you must have access to all the shared services the Foundation has provided to the chapter. All leaders are equal and responsibile to maintain the chapter activity to meet requirements to keep the chapter open. It is also the continguency plan if one or more leaders needs to take personal leave or becomes ill. The lack of access to the shared services by the remaining leadership will not be considered justification to not close the chapter.
* Any other social media platforms login and password must be shared with all active leaders. 
    * The login and password must be passed on to the new leadership or if not applicable MUST be closed. If the chapter is closed the leadership is responsible to close all social media accounts created for chapter or remove all usage of the OWASP® word and logo to comply with trademark guidelines.
